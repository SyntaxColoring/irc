This is the code that I use to host my personal instance of [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/).

It's in two parts:

1. [`ansible/`](ansible/) has Ansible playbooks for installing and maintaining The Lounge and its supporting software.
2. [`tf/`](tf/) is a Terraform module to provide the underlying server.

See the readmes in those directories for more details.
